# Email Sync Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Rich Markup Tag Parsing Error
**Issue**: `closing tag '[/red]' at position 69 doesn't match any open tag`

**Root Cause**: The imapsync output contained Rich markup tags that were being processed incorrectly, causing parsing errors.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Added line cleaning in `sync.py` to strip Rich markup tags before processing
- Updated line 195 to clean output: `clean_line = line.replace('[red]', '').replace('[/red]', '')...`

### 2. Improved OAuth Token Management
**Issue**: Token expiration and refresh handling

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced token refresh logic in `oauth.py` 
- Increased refresh buffer from 5 to 10 minutes for more conservative token management
- Added better error handling for token validation

### 3. Enhanced IMAP Connection Parameters
**Fix Applied**:
- Added Office 365 specific connection parameters in `sync.py`:
  - `--timeout1 120` and `--timeout2 120` for longer connection timeouts
  - `--split1 100` and `--split2 100` for better message handling
  - `--skipheader Content-Type` and `--skipheader Content-Transfer-Encoding` to avoid parsing issues
- Reduced parallel processing to 1 worker to avoid connection conflicts

### 4. Removed Invalid imapsync Options
**Issue**: Invalid command line options causing imapsync to fail

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed unrecognized options: `--reconnectretries1`, `--reconnectretries2`, `--keepalive`
- These options were not supported by the installed version of imapsync

## Remaining Issue: "BAD User is authenticated but not connected"

### Current Status
The OAuth authentication is working correctly (as shown by `status` command), but imapsync encounters "BAD User is authenticated but not connected" errors from Office 365.

### Possible Causes
1. **Microsoft Security Policies**: Office 365 has enhanced security that may limit IMAP access even with valid OAuth tokens
2. **Conditional Access Policies**: The organization may have policies restricting IMAP access
3. **Modern Authentication Requirements**: Office 365 may require additional authentication flows

### Recommendations for Further Investigation

1. **Check Office 365 IMAP Settings**:
   ```bash
   # Check if IMAP is enabled for the user
   # This requires admin access to Exchange Online
   Get-CASMailbox -Identity "corina.macri@horetim.org" | Select-Object ImapEnabled
   ```

2. **Verify App Registration Permissions**:
   - Ensure the Azure app has correct API permissions
   - Consider adding "Mail.ReadWrite" permission in addition to "IMAP.AccessAsUser.All"

3. **Alternative Approach - Use Microsoft Graph API**:
   - Consider migrating from IMAP to Microsoft Graph API for better reliability
   - Graph API provides more stable access to Office 365 mailboxes

4. **Test with Different Authentication Method**:
   - Try using app passwords if the organization allows them
   - Test with a different OAuth scope configuration

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Test current status
./email_sync.py status

# Test dry run
./email_sync.py sync --dry-run

# Enable debug logging for detailed output
./email_sync.py sync --debug --dry-run
```

## Files Modified
- `sync.py`: Enhanced connection handling and error message processing
- `oauth.py`: Improved token refresh logic
- `email_sync.py`: Fixed console output formatting

## Conclusion
The application-level errors have been resolved. The remaining "BAD User is authenticated but not connected" error is related to Office 365's IMAP access policies and may require administrative changes or alternative approaches for resolution.
